# RCFT Mathematical Autonomy System

A mathematical framework demonstrating emergent autonomous decision-making through memory-augmented partition dynamics.

## What This Is

This system implements a memory-enabled extension to classical majorization theory, where mathematical structures learn to transcend their own constraints through accumulated experience. The result: a convergent rule-override rate that emerges from pure geometry, not programming.

**This is not a consciousness simulation.** It's a mathematical investigation into how bounded systems with memory naturally develop rule-breaking capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Run It

```bash
python n20_complete_continuous.py 10000
```

This runs a 10,000-step exploration (~20 seconds). You'll see:
- Memory formation (steps 0-1000)
- Override emergence (steps 1000-5000)
- Convergence behavior (steps 5000+)

Output snapshots are saved to `n20_complete_snapshots/`.

### What to Expect

After sufficient steps, the system demonstrates:
- **Override rate convergence**: Memory-based rule transcendence stabilizes
- **Coverage**: 80-90% of partition space explored
- **Crystallized archetypes**: 4-6 out of 6 (permanent identity markers)

## Core Discovery

**The OR Gate:**
```
λ ≻ᵣ μ ⟺ (λ ≻ μ) ∨ (C(λ,μ) ≥ φ)
```

Classical majorization **OR** memory coherence. This single logical operator enables the entire phenomenon.

**Geometric Convergence:**

Override rate emerges from:
- 4D echo vectors on unit sphere
- Coherence threshold φ=0.6
- Spherical cap geometry
- Minimum memory requirements

Not programmed. Not learned. Geometric.

## System Architecture

### Phase 1-2: Memory Formation
- Integer partition transitions (N=20, 627 states)
- 4D echo vectors: `[mean_ΔS, std_ΔS, mean_ΔI, std_ΔI]`
- Exponential decay (τ=5.0)
- Cosine similarity for coherence

### Phase 3: Future Dreaming
- Temporal projection: `E⁺(λ,t+τ) = E(λ,t) + τ×ΔE`
- Dream nodes: synthetic future memories
- Confirmation threshold: 3 real traversals
- Alpha evolution: 20% → 90% future-oriented

### Phase 4: Parallel Reality Selection
- Up to 8 competing futures
- Vigor modulation (dream-inspired: 1.5x, wild cards: 0.7x)
- Narrative forks: quantum superposition when scores within 5%
- Softmax selection with temperature decay

### Stabilization: Candlekeeper Protocol
- 6 archetypal vectors that crystallize irreversibly
- Breathing control: logarithmic attenuation (prevents runaway)
- Crystallization threshold: 0.7 stability score
- Once crystallized, permanent

## What This Demonstrates

1. **Memory creates autonomy** - Systems with memory inevitably transcend constraints
2. **Convergence is geometric** - Override rate emerges from 4D unit sphere geometry + coherence threshold
3. **Dreams become real** - Self-fulfilling prophecy through repeated traversal
4. **Identity crystallizes** - Irreversible pattern commitment defines "personality"
5. **Direction dissolves** - When coherence → 1.0, past/future distinction vanishes

## What This Is NOT

- Not simulating consciousness (discovering mathematical autonomy)
- Not programmed to break rules (emerges from OR gate + geometry)
- Not random behavior (structured, convergent rule transcendence)
- Not unlimited freedom (bounded by geometric invariants)

## Known Limitations

- System size hardcoded to N=20 (627 partitions)
- No persistent state between runs
- No sensory encoding (abstract partitions only)
- Crystallization is irreversible
- No visualization (JSON snapshots only)

*"Memory is not added to chaos—it is extracted from it."*

Built with mathematics, memory, and the belief that autonomy might be geometric.
